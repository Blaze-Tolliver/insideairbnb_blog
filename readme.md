#Analysis Results Summary
I analyzed three broad questions about Airbnb usage in Bristol, UK. 
1. What's the trend for Airbnb usage in Bristol since the first listings inÂ 2011?
2. What does it take to have a frequently visited listing that remains popular long-term?
3. Can the written comment sentiment be used to approximate the average numeric rating for listings?
4. What are the price distributions in each neighborhood for short-term listings?
